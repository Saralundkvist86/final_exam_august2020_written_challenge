## Written submission
Please explain the steps you think are necessary to perform to get a feature done, from an idea to an implemented solution that is running in production. Be as detailed as possible. 

Make a PR with your submission to this repository.

Most important is that the one/the full team is clear of how the end product will look like before they start.
It doesnt matter if you plan the feature your self or if someone else planned it for you. The planning of the feature should be written down and in a way that some one coming from the outside quickly understand what it is about.
I would say the planning is the most important part to get a feature done, especially as soon as possible. If a team invested in good planning the risk of doing the wrong thing is eliminated.

When planning t's important to have in mind that peoples take in information differently, some prefer to listen, some to read and some are more visual and understands drawings better.
Ultimate is to do a short explanation of the feature in words with an attached sketch. 
The written part is very vell done with a userstorie - a short explanation written from the user perspective which is very simple and easy to interpret.

If its a view-feature draw a lofi of the view so everyone in the team can confirm that they understand the ending product. When a team both talks, draws and whrites its a bigger chanse of getting the planning done without any misunderstandings. If it is a server-feature only it can still be good to do a drawing of associations etc within the database. 

A drawing of the view is also good to do when a client hands over the task. Its better to take a few minutes to make a sketch and say "if i understands you correct you want it too look something like this .. " 
Instead of taking the risk to redo the whole feature if the client had something else in mind that you imagen.

When it's time to start working on the feature I definetely think its most important to start with a test.
To perform TDD is really time effective and of couse also proves that the code works and do not break when running.
To search for errors without a proper test can be very time consuming and sometimes manually testing is not enough. 

When coding it's always important to put the user in centrum and have the ending product in mind. What has most value for the user - prioritize that.

When the feature is done its important to get a impartial imput from someone who hasnt worked on the code. Someone who can question your code and come with constructive feedback so you can deliver top noch code!
